# @tetra/server

The Tetra server architecture is heavily inspired by Nest.js's ([which the server used to be built with](https://github.com/depthbomb/tetra/tree/3b09e22d8c23cb81dbc1e182ca3ed92c8b9efa85/packages/tetra-server)) where components of the backend are organized into "modules" that may use features of other modules.
